    "text": "Model Summary Tables\n\nEvictions\n\nOfficial SWL (Borough-Level) Methodology\n\nThe coefficients on the interaction-weighted average treatment effect on the treated (IWATT) for all models are significant and model fit is similar across models. However, in Model 1 and Model 2, the effect is strong and positive, indicating a relatively greater level of evictions in buildings with suspected speculative sales, while in Model 3 the coefficient flipsnegative. Though the change in the sign in the coefficient may be due to the relatively smallerproportion of treated units in the third model, these results at present must be interpreted as presenting an ambiguous relationship between real estate speculation as identified by relativecapitalization rate at the borough level and the number of evictions in periods following a potentially speculative purchase.\n\n\nNTA-Level Methodology\n\nWhen repeating the above analysis at the NTA level, all coefficients are positive and model fit is similarly strong across models. These results suggest a strong relationship between a relatively low capitalization rate at time of purchase when measured at the neighborhood level and an annual increase in the number of evictions at the purchased property in years following the sale, with a 25% cutoff in capitalization rates producing the most sensitive response.\n\n\n\nHPD Violations\n\nOfficial SWL (Borough-Level) Methodology\n\nThere appears to be no significant relationship between the number of HPD violations and a building’s status according to these three watchlist specifications when the official SWL (borough-level) speculative sale indicator criteria is applied.\n\n\nNTA-Level Methodology\n\nAlternatively setting the threshold at the NTA’s quarterly bottom 25th percentile of capitalization rates leads to a stronger level of statistical significance and improves model fit overall. Applying a capitalization rate based speculation indicator at the NTA level appears overall more sensitive regardless of the cutoff rate selected."
